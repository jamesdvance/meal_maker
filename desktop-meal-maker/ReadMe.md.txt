Meal Maker Desktop: 

Prototype of meal maker functionality running on spaghetti code on my desktop. Use it to refine mealplan guru's function before implementing full architecture. 

Consists of - 

*Python Notebooks
*Python scripts with odbc connection to mm RDS database
*Meal Plan outputs in CSV
*User preferences in CSV
*Likes and dislikes - will solve for that later
